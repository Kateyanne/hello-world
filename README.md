# hello-world
Just starting up and really lost. Looking forward to coming back in a few months to read this and chuckle at what I didn't know that I didn't know.
More about me: I live in the Oregon High Desert. We have 10' snow on average in winter; in the summer, temperatures climb to 100 in the day, and can drop to the 40s at night. I have a little therapy dog and a tiny garden. Writer, editor, project manager, cat herder.

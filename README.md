# hello-world
Just starting up and really lost. Looking forward to coming back in a few months to read this and chuckle at what I didn't know that I didn't know.

Well, still feeling confused but forging ahead!

My reviewer, who is me, just asked me to say more. One thing I can say is that I'm working with really smart and helpful people. Isn't that always wonderful?
